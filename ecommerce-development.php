                <h3>Product Filtering</h3>
                <p>Allowing your users to customize their e-commerce experience on your website by giving them the ability to filter through your category pages 
                    based on prices, popularity, and more is an essential tool for any website to have. Customers don’t enjoy clicking through endless pages of products,
                    so having a “View All” option is also a good idea to make things easier.</p>

                <h3>Product Details</h3>
                <p>It is very important to provide all of your product information, including extensive details about each of your products in a clean, concise, manner.
                If a customer cannot find all the product information they are looking for, they may feel too uncertain to complete their purchase. When products,
                sizes, or colors do happen to go out of stock, allow customers to sign up to be notified of when the product they were looking for becomes available.
                This way they are less likely to go to a competitor, and it shows that you care about serving their needs.</p>

                <h3>Dynamic Shopping Cart</h3>
                <p>When a visitor adds an item to their shopping cart, make sure to display the cart on the page in a small window that dynamically populates with the product(s) 
                    the customer is adding. This way the user experience is smooth and the customer is assured that their goods have been added to the cart. Sometimes, visitors 
                    may add a number of items to their shopping cart without having the intention of actually completing their purchase. Rather than forcing your customers to 
                    make the choice between deleting a product from your cart or buying it, allow them to save it for later instead.</p>

                <h3>Shipping Options</h3>
                <p>It’s essential for any successful ecommerce site to avoid using a single or flat rate for shipping. Different customers will want different shipping mods – 
                    some want their products to arrive immediately and others are fine with paying less for slower shipping. Since the checkout process is a significant investment
                     of time and effort, allow customers to calculate the shipping costs directly from their shopping carts before they 
                     start going through the checkout process.</p>
