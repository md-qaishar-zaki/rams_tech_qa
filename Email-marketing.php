            <h3 class="text-center">Audience Research & Data Collection</h3>
            <p>It is important to know the nature of your email recipients in order to cater towards their attitudes, culture, and expectations.</p>
            <p>Try to gather as much relevant information about your audience as you can from your email signup form. Some examples of information you 
                might want to ask for include title, company, and location. Only ask for information that you will actually use to segment your email 
                campaigns, as asking for too much information can decrease your rate of email signup.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Analyze Goals & Objectives</h3>
            <p>Most recipients spend no more than a couple seconds when viewing an email, so it’s critical that your campaigns are designed to be both 
            cohesive and compelling to engage with.</p>
            <p>Whether you are supplying an informational resource or marketing a product with your email marketing campaign, a single focus must be decided upon in 
            order to grab your recipients’ attention and direct them towards your desired action. Too many different calls to action and pieces of unrelated content 
            can cause users to stray from accomplishing the intended goal of an email.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Email Design</h3>
            <p>We design and structure your emails to cater towards your goals and your audience. Through careful placement of strong calls to action and supporting images,
            we help your campaigns drive results.</p>
            <p>The goal of an email is to trigger clicks and drive traffic to your site. Once there, it is important to fulfill subscribers’ expectations and use landing pages 
            that reflect whatever your email is advertising. As a brand, you want to offer a consistent user experience to your customers for the entire campaign so that in 
            turn, the experience drives conversions.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Email Optimization</h3>
            <p>Nobody likes to receive an email that isn’t addressing their specific needs. We send relevant messages to users who want them through use of segmentation, analytics, 
            and past user activity.</p>
            <p>All of our email marketing campaigns take advantage of A/B testing options to measure and optimize your click-through and open rates. This helps to make sure that 
            your newsletters are created with email best practices, as well as brand-specific data or the use of email automation, which allows us to create an email that is
            perfectly tailored to your customers.</p>

            <p>To make sure that the highest percentage of subscribers open and click-through your email campaign, we will find the optimal time and 
            frequency to distribute campaigns.</p>
            <p>Our email marketing solutions are always focused on driving results. We thoroughly analyze findings and aim to understand user behavior surrounding 
            email campaigns, and use our insights to develop an approach that best fits the needs of your brand and users. This phase of
